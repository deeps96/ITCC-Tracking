# ITCC-Tracking
This project was created based on the requirement of the IT-Talents Code Competition 02/2018. The goal was to develop a tracking web service.

## Getting started
This repository uses three branches for vagrant, frontend and backend in order to avoid having multiple repos.
The vagrant branch contains all required files to build the VM with the front end and backend already deployed.
Check out the frontend and backend branches to deploy the app yourself.
