# Used technologies/ frameworks etc.
The backend is based on a Java stack and uses mainly the Spring Boot Framework for the REST-Interface of the tracking service.
Furhtermore the project uses Lombok to generate Getters & Setters during compiling in order to increase readability.
SonarLint is used as Lint checker.

## IDE
I used IntelliJ to develop - if you want to compile the project you need to install the Lombok plugin first.
